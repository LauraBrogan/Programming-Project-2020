# Project for Programming for Data Analysis 2020

## Summary of Assignment
This repository contains my programming for data analysis project 2020. It looks at 

My notebook contains explanation for each of the ?? lines of input code with ?? lines of output code.

I commenced work on this assignment on 22nd November 2020 and completed work for the deadline of 21st December 2020.
I struggled a lot to understand what was required for this project.  I decided to look at previous works on this topic to get a grip of what exactly was required.  I then decided i would keep my project basic and use the tips data set and then

## Liabries used in this Assignment
I impoted: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Matplolib is a Python 20 plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive enviroments across platforms.

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

## Running the Jupyter Notebook 1
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows): jupyter notebook This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.

Download the notebook you want to execute and put it in your notebook folder (or a sub-folder of it).

Then follow these steps: Launch the Jupyter Notebook App (see previous section). In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etcâ€¦).
